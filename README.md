### 💼 **About Me:**
Hi there 👋. I’m Sachin Guria, a dedicated and results-driven Data Analyst with a strong foundation in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven decision-making**. With a passion for uncovering insights from data, I enjoy transforming raw information into valuable, actionable outcomes. My work spans across diagnosing liver disease with machine learning models, managing flight data with Django, and visualizing trends through interactive dashboards.

While I’m focused on enhancing my data expertise, I’m also enthusiastic about learning new technologies and staying updated with the latest industry trends. **When I’m not exploring data, I’m probably enjoying music or pondering life’s bigger questions**.
